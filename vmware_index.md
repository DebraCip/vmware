# Getting started tutorial

VMware provides an industry-leading virtualization platform that abstracts processor, memory, storage, and networking resources to create multiple {{site.data.keyword.virtualmachinesshort}} on a single physical server. Multiple physical servers can be clustered together to create a private cloud.

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} provides the unique capability for customers to provision dedicated {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} upon which they can deploy their own VMware based private cloud. For example, you can enable the creation of a hybrid cloud where on-premises VMware based servers, tooling, and processes can be extended into the public cloud. 

| Get Started       |
|:------------------|
| __ 1. Learn about the [VMware and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/infrastructure/vmware?topic=VMware-about-vmware-and-ibm-cloud) feature. |
| __ 2. Review the [licensing options](/docs/infrastructure/vmware?topic=VMware-vmware-licensing-options) and [storage options](/docs/infrastructure/vmware?topic=VMware-storage-to-use-with-vmware-systems).|
| __ 3. To deploy a basic single-site VMware environment running in an IBM Cloud data center, see [Getting Started with VMware vSphere 6](/docs/infrastructure/vmware?topic=VMware-getting-started-with-vmware-vsphere-6). |

## Next Steps

After you have a basic environment configured, you can [manage licenses](/docs/infrastructure/vmware?topic=VMware-managing-vmware-licenses).

For more information about an advanced reference architecture that outlines a hybrid cloud configuration, see [VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) on IBM Cloud](/docs/infrastructure/vmware?topic=VMware-vmware-sddc-on-ibm-cloud).
