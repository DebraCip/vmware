# Getting started tutorial

VMware provides an industry-leading virtualization platform that abstracts processor, memory, storage, and networking resources to create multiple {{site.data.keyword.virtualmachinesshort}} on a single physical server. Multiple physical servers can be clustered together to create a private cloud.

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} provides the unique capability for customers to provision dedicated {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} upon which they can deploy their own VMware based private cloud. For example, you can enable the creation of a hybrid cloud where on-premises VMware based servers, tooling, and processes can be extended into the public cloud. 

| Get Started       |
|:------------------|
| __ 1. Learn about the [VMware and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](vmware-6-topic-description.html) feature. |
| __ 2. Review the [licensing options](vmware-vsphere-6.html) and [storage options](select-storage-option-use-vmware.html).|
| __ 3. To deploy a basic single-site VMware environment running in an IBM Cloud data center, see [Getting Started with VMware vSphere 6](vmware-vsphere-6-getting-started.html). |

## Next Steps

After you have a basic environment configured, you can [manage licenses](manage-vmware-licenses.html).

For more information about an advanced reference architecture that outlines a hybrid cloud configuration, see [VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) on IBM Cloud](vmware-sddc-ibm-cloud.html).
