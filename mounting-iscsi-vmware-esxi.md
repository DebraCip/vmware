# Mounting iSCSI VMWare ESXi

Mounting iSCSI into VMWare ESXi can be accomplished with a few steps and only the details of the server and storage node. **Note:** If you want to connect multiple ESXi servers to the same ISCSI LUNs, the Host Authorization limit for ISCSI is eight hosts.

1. Log in to the vSphere by using the Primary Private IP and user **root** and root's password.
* From the Welcome Page, click the **Configuration** tab.
* Click **Storage adapters** > **Addâ€¦**.
* Click **OK** to add the Software iSCSI adapter.
* Confirm by clicking **OK**.
* After the refresh, the new iSCSI adapter is listed.
* Click **Properties**.
* From the Properties Window, click **Configure** and set the **Name** to the IQN for the server(found on the storage device page under authorized hosts).
* Click the **Dynamic Discovery Tab** then click the **Add...**.
* The iSCSI server is the target IP of the storage device, then click **CHAP..**.
* Select **Use CHAP** and clear **Inherit from Parent**. Input the **User name** (found on the storage device page under authorized hosts) and its password.
* Select **Do not use CHAP** under the Mutual CHAP section then click **OK**.
* You now see the device in the Dynamic Discovery Window, click **Close**.
* Confirm the Rescan of the storage devices.
* The device turns gray and is 'unmounted.'
* Right-click the device name and select **attach**.
* Click the **Data store** Menu on the left side column then click **add storage** and choose **Disc/LUN**.
* Click the device with the 'iqn.'
* Choose the file system version that you want and click **Next**.
* You can now use the iSCSI.



Attaching a Data Transfer Service iSCSI device is the same, except you need to get the IQN from the server.  You complete the following steps from the ESXi console:

You need to get the device:

`esxcfg-scsidevs -a | grep iSCSI`

You also need to get the IQN (in this case, vmhba33 is the iSCSI device):

`vmkiscsi-tool -I -l vmhba33`
